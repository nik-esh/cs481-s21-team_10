# Meeting 8

- Attendance: All attended

We lost one of our teammates this week. He had to drop the class for personal reasons so we have become a team of two now. This week though I'm working on creating the landing page for our application. The landing page would give our users the ability to log in to our app and see any relevant information about Logzly.

Here's what I'm planning to do next:
- Work on creating an authentication page for our application with buttons that would allow users to authenticate with various third-party providers.
