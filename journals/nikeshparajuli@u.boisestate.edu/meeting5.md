# Meeting 5

- Attendance: All attended

This week our team worked on the Testing lab. We wrote a few tests for our server side code using chai, mocha, and supertest testing libraries. We then added the instructions to run the tests in the test.sh file.

Here's what I'm planning to do this week:
- Look into what Next.js has to offer in terms of making things easy with routing and serving pages.
- Look ahead into things we may be doing in the CI lab.
