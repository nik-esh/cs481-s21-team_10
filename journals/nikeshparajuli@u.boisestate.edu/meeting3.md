# Meeting 3

- Attendance: All attended

This week our team reviewed and decided on the programming language and the potential frameworks that we might use for our project. Our team preferred an all-javascript solution so we settled on using NodeJS for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. We then filled out the tech lab section in the project Readme. We also put together a simple 'hello-world' app in our project repo using NodeJS and React.

Here's what I'm planning to do this week:
- Research necessary things that we might want to put into our build.sh and clean.sh files.
