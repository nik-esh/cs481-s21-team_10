# Meeting 7

- Attendance: All attended

This week our team worked on the Planning lab. We created some UI mocks for our application and outlined the general workflow of our program. We divided our app into three major components and created user stories for them using the role-goal-benefit format. We then worked on dividing our user stories into roughly 5 tasks each and estimated the approximate time and effort that will be needed to complete them.

Here's what I'm planning to do this week:
- Work on creating a landing page for our application with login and get started buttons and any other relevant information about our app.
