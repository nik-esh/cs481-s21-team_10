# Meeting 2

- Attendance: All attended

During this week's meeting we mostly worked on brainstorming ideas for our capstone project. All of us had a couple of ideas to share and we listened to them very carefully and offered suggestions on how we could make it even better. Then we all ranked the ideas by preference and voted on the best one. For the top choices, we reflected on how relevant the idea was, checked to see if there were similar apps, and evaluated if the idea was doable in a couple of weeks. We then discussed more on the idea we went with and drafted our project epic accordingly. We also decided on our app name during this meeting.

I think our team is making pretty good progress so far. We've tried to complete tasks early so that we can enjoy some flexibility if such need arises. We hope to continue doing this for the rest of the semester.

Here's what I'm planning to do this week:
- Research about the programming language we might use in our project.
- Research about relevant frameworks for each of the potential programming languages so that we don't have to reinvent the wheel.
