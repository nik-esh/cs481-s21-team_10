# Meeting 6

- Attendance: All attended

This week our team worked on the Continuous Integration lab. We utilized GitHub Actions to build and run tests for our project. We used the defualt Node.js template provided by GitHub for our repo. We tweaked the yml file a little bit to suit our needs and defined names for the steps we executed so that it was easier to see them from the Actions summary.

Here's what I'm planning to do this week:
- Continue looking into Next.js stuff and its libraries
- Think ahead on the mvp features that we will want to implement for our app
