# Meeting 5

- Attendance: All attended

This week my group and I worked through the testing lab. This lab was not as easy as we initially thought because setting up the tests took a bit of research on the various testing frameworks. We also had to decide what we wanted to test and add some temporary code that we could use for testing. Once we spend some time discussing some of the design choices we decided to move forward with a combination of the packages; supertest, chai, and mocha for our testing. Once we had these decided we created an example endpoint in the server of our application and used these packages to create a few example tests using the temporary '/test' endpoint. Then we edited the test.sh file in order for it to run the tests. Lastly, we also spend a bit of time trying to get routing working for the front end with minimal luck. 

My task for this week:

- Research and work on Github actions and Status Badges for continuous integration of our application
- Try to get the routing working for the front end of our application
