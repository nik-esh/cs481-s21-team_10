# Meeting 2

- Attendance: All attended

During this week's meeting, we completed the project brainstorm. We all came to the meeting with a couple of ideas and then had a discussion talking about the pros and cons of each idea and then worked toward picking our favorite. In the end, we chose the app Logzly which will be an application for journaling. After we chose our app we had to work on creating an overview of the application, thinking of an app name, creating some goals, and looking at some of the possible potential users and use cases.  

I think that our team is on a good track for this point of the semester. And I am happy that we were all able to agree on a project. I look forward to getting started on it!

My task for this week:

- Think of and research possible frameworks/languages that we may be able to use
- Discuss with the team about the best language and/or framework
- Work on creating a simple "Hello World" program in the selected language
