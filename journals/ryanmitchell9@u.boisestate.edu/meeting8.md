# Meeting 8

- Attendance: All attended

This week we started to change our main focus to our tasks. For me, this included working on our group page. I mainly focused on just creating the UI and some routing for this page. We also lost one of our group members this week due to personal reasons. So we also discussed some ways on how to move forward with this. We tentatively decided to try to take on his tasks but cut some of our more advantageous features. But we also decided that it would probably be best to talk with Shane about the best way to move forward.

My task for this week:
- Talk with Shane about how our project may change due to a group member of ours leaving.
- Continue to work on our group page. This will include continuing to add to the user interface and add some functionality to the interface.
- If there is time, see what I can transfer from the group page to the log page.
