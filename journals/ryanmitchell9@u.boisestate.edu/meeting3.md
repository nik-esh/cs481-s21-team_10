# Meeting 3

- Attendance: All attended

During this week's meeting, our team discussed some potential frameworks and languages that we will use for our application. We started the meeting by just discussing some available options for both frontend and backend languages and frameworks. We eventually ended up deciding on React for the frontend and nodeJS for the backend. After we decided on our languages and frameworks we worked through the tech lab section of the project's README. After this, we created a simple Hello World project in those languages and frameworks. This took some work to get nodeJS to serve our React frontend, but eventually, we were able to create a stable Hello World project.

My task for this week:

- Continue thinking about features and designs for the project
- Research and work on what we need in our build.sh and clean.sh files
