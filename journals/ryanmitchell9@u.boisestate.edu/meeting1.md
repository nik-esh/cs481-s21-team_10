# Meeting 1

- Attendance: All attended

We all were able to attend this week and last. During this time we completed the Setup Lab. So we all accepted the Github Classroom assignment, added the contributers, added an MIT license to the project, and worked together to complete the team contract. In addition, we also created the folders for our journals and began work on those. Lastly, we discussed what we need to do next regarding this project.

My task for this week:

- Review project ideas from class
- Come up with at least two suitable project ideas
- Work with team to decide on the best project idea
