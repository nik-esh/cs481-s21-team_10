# Meeting 6

- Attendance: All attended

This week my group and I worked on the continuous integration lab. To complete this lab we used Github actions in order to automatically deploy and test our application on every push to our repository. I have used some Github actions before but found it very informative to work through an example from the start. We started by using an example Github action for Node.js. We made a few changes to the provided YAML file for things such as when to run the action and what it is actually going to run. We changed it to run on every push and to run our build.sh and test.sh files. In addition, this week we also added a link in our README to show a status badge of the action. Lastly, we also added a short description of how we accomplished this lab in our README under the CI Lab section.

My task for this week:

- See if I can get routing working for the front end of our application
- Brainstorm additional features and designs we need for our application
