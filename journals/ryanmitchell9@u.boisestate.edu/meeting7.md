# Meeting 7

- Attendance: All attended

This week my group and I worked on the planning lab. We initially started this lab by creating a simple wireframe of our application for an initial point of planning so we had a base understanding of what our application should look and feel like. From there we found that we could divide the work fairly easily into three different sections. One for the authentication and landing page, one for the group page, and one for the log page. We discussed our preferences and we able to distribute the work using these three parts of the application. I decided to work on the group page so my next step was to complete the planning document. This included creating a user story, creating and estimating five tasks, and determining a definition of done for each task. Then lastly, I added a link to this document in the README after it was pushed.

My task for this week:

- Work through my first task in my planning document; create a front end for the group page with buttons for adding groups, selecting the groups, logging out, joining a group, and leaving/deleting groups
