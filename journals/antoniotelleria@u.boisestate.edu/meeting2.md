# Meeting 2

- Attendance: all present

This week, we discussed and selected an idea for our project.

The team believes that the format of journaling used in this class is "inconvinient".  Students must create and keep track of multiple
journal entries.  These journal entries must be uploaded individually by each team member to the team repository, which pollutes the
commit history of the repository and creates an abundance of small, largely meaningless files.  The instructor, for their part, must
navigate individually to each of these files in order to view our journal entries (although I am confident our instructor will cheat
and utilize a script of some sort to speed up this process).  

The proposed solution is "Logzly" (eww), a journalling website.  An instructor will create a group and assign students to it.
Students will upload their journals to this group.  The website will use a permission structure to control who is allowed to view
journal entries.  Ideally, the website will include the ability to present journal entries to users in an organized manner.  Github
integration is planned so as to provide means by which journal entries can be sorted and viewed.

For my part, I admit to being an idiot with regards to working with websites, which is sort of a major problem on a project like this.
I will work with my teammates to select a framework so that I can begin learning how to use it in preperation for doing actual work on
the website.  At least we have three(ish) months to make this thing work.

Tasks for next week:
- Elaborate on key website concepts and generate preliminary stories/tasks
- Discuss technical underpinnings for the website
- Select a framework to work with moving forward
