# Meeting 7

Attendance:
- All present

This week, we planned out a prototype of our website and crafted user stories.  For my part, I will
(to the best of my ability) design the "create post" and "edit post" pages, and may also be responsible
for providing hookups for our website to a Google Firebase database.  Our pages will be designed using
the NextJS and Material Design UI frameworks because omg flat is beautiful~ and NextJS seems less dumb
than straight React.

I have been a bit out of it lately, hence the missed deadline for my planning doc.  Sorry about that.

To do:
- Learn NextJS
- Research Firebase, set up DB instance
- More learning as required
- Begin working on tasks
