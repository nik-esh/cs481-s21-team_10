# Meeting 1

- Attendance: all present

This week, we completed the tasks associated with the setup lab:

 - Designed a team contract
 - Selected a license for our project (MIT License)
 - Team members verified that they had access to the repository
 
We worked on brainstorming ideas for projects.  I had a thought about creating a search engine for locating media across
streaming services, but such a service would be contingient on major streaming services proving public APIs, which you THINK
would be a given, but isn't...also searching sucks.  We agreed to keep researching ideas.

My tasks for this week:

- Continue researching project ideas
- Meet with team as needed to develop project ideas
- By next week, the team must agree on a project
