# Meeting 5

Attendance:
- All present

This week, we tried to implement some basic testing in the project, using Javascript libraries like Mocha and Chai. 
Or, at least, Nikesh and Ryan did, while I stood there staring like an idiot.  My learning is not progressing as
fast as I'd like, but oh well.  I'll keep working on it.

The more I try to learn about this, the more it occurs to me that we need more concrete specifications for our
website: what it looks like, what it does, and how it does it.  I wil harass my teammates about this later.

To do:
- Continue learning
- Research CI schemes in preparation for this week's meeting
- Define our website
