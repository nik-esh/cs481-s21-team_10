# Meeting 3

Attendance:
- All present

This week, the team researched and discussed various frameworks for building our website.  Our site will employ seperate frontend and
backend solutions, and probably some sort of database component as well.

For the frontend, we chose React.js over alternatives such as Angular.  React is percieved as an desirable framework to have experience
with, and we all wanted to learn more.  For the backend, we chose Node.js over alternatives such as Vue.js.  My fellow teammates had prior
experience with Node (but not a lot), so they felt confident that they could learn more.

The team then collectively built our "hello world" example during the zoom meeting using React and Node.  For my part, I...didn't actually
help with that at all.  I have zero experience with any type of web design beyond HTML, so I spent most of the time just feeling lost.  I
face a significant challenge in learning enough to be able to make substantive contributions to the project, but I have confidence that my
teammates can help me along the way as we continue to work on our project.

To do:
- Review basic web technologies
- Begin learning React
- Begin learning Node
- Study the use of React and Node in our "Hello World" example
