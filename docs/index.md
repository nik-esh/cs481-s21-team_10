# Logzly

### Abstract:
Logzly is a group journaling application for developers in teams. It allows team managers and members to see what the fellow developers are working on a particular day or throughout the week. It is very useful to allow coworkers to see what their team members are working on, what they could possibly need help with, and what they have previously worked on. This makes it very easy for developers to stay organized with their team and keep track of what they have worked on themselves. Daily stand-up meetings are an integral part of software development teams, and with coronavirus, people working from home, and developers working in different time zones these meetings can be easily overlooked. Logzly provides a common platform for teams to share their daily updates.
