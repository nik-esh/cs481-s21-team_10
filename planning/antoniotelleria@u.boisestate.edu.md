## User Story

As a user of Logzly, I need to be able to upload, edit, and delete my own posts,
and I also need to be able to view all posts made by my group so that I can
efficiently communicate with my teammates.

## Tasks

1. Establish a database instance to maintain post data
2. Design and implement a 'Create Post' webpage/window for our app
3. Design and implement an 'Edit Post' webpage/window for our app
4. Link 'Create Post' webpage actions to database
5. Link 'Edit Post' webpage actions to database

### Time estimation method

Based on consulation with my teammates who are more experienced with such tasks, and
taking into account BSU regulations and my own lack of experience, I estimate that these
tasks will take me 10-15 hours of work apiece.

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD - I will know I am done when all members of our group can successfully
upload, retrieve, and edit data located within a database instance.
- Task 2 DOD - I will know I am done when I have created a 'Create Post' webpage
that passes our UI tests and can be accessed from other pages of our app
- Task 3 DOD - I will know I am done when I have created a 'Edit Post' webpage
that passes our UI tests and can be accessed from other pages of our app
- Task 4 DOD - I will know I am done when submiting a post to the 'Create Post'
webpage succesfully updates the database with the post content, and the post
content is displayed on the appropriate 'view posts' webpage.
- Task 5 DOD -  I will know I am done when updating a post to the Edit Post'
webpage succesfully updates the database with the altered post content, and the
altered post content is displayed on the appropriate 'view posts' webpage.
