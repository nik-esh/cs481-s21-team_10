## User Story

As a user of Logzly, I should be able to log in to the app using third-party services such as GitHub or Google so that I can securely interact with the application to create or join groups and submit logs.

## Tasks

1. I will need to create a landing page for the users to be able to get started with our application. The landing page will include the login and get started butttons with any additional information about the app and how to use it.
2. I will need to create an authentication page that would allow the users to choose the type of provider they want to use for login. This page will also be used to authenticate users who try to access our app from a shared link.
3. I will need to create a database in firebase to store users' credentials and authenticate them using various providers like GitHub and Google.
4. I will need to create the backend logic to sanitize user credentials and authenticate them into Logzly.
5. I will need to create an app bar in Logzly where the users should be able to see their profile information.

### Time estimation method

Based on the guidelines for this class and our previous experience in other classes and in the industry, we estimated that our tasks should take us about 8-9 hours maximum every week. The work will probably include time for researching new concepts and any additional hours for reviewing pull requests or attending group meetings.

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD - I will know that I am done when the landing page looks similar to the mockups we created.
- Task 2 DOD - I will know that I am done when the authentication page looks similar to the mockups we created and if the app sends the users to this page if they try to access a group/log without logging in first.
- Task 3 DOD - I will know that I am done when I can see the schema created in the firebase console.
- Task 4 DOD - I will know that I am done when me and my teammates can succesfully log into Logzly using our GitHub or Google accounts.
- Task 5 DOD - I will know that I am done when we all agree on the design of the app bar and that it shows a user's profile picture with a dropdown to see other information at the very least.
