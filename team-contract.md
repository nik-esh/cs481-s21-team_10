# Team contract template
The purpose of this contract is to outline the expectations and responsibilities of the team members so that all members get to participate equally and work can be completed on time.

## Group Work Expectations
All team members must meet on the agreed upon time unless an emergency occurs.
All team members must stay until tasks are completed or determined that they will be completed independently.
Determining what group members should contribute from sprint to sprint.

## Individual responsibilities
Individuals will be responsible for completing their assigned tasks by the defined deadline or all team members must agree to a new deadline for the task.
Keeping the team updated on progress.

## Grade reduction procedure
If a team member misses two or more deadlines without permission, or contributes inadequate work, as documented by git commits, then the other team members can, at their discretion, apply for a grade reduction.

## Firing procedure
After the grade reduction procedure has been issued, this will act as a warning for the firing procedure. The student in question and the professor will be emailed about this warning. And if the student in question’s behavior does not change in at least one week and the following weeks of the semester (behavior change will be determined by the other group members), then that student will be fired.

## Punishment for doing a git push –force
Record a warning for doing a git push --force the first time, a grade reduction for a second offense, and then automatic firing on a third offense.
